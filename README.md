#### >Lab-01. predicting the TCDD level

__Data:__ The data set 'AgOrange.xlsx' is related to a study of Vietnam War veterans who were exposed to Agent-Orange(TCDD) herbicide during the confict. The data set contians TCDD levels in both "plasma" and "fat tissue" for 20 veterans. One goal of us is to determine the degree of linear association between these two variables. We want to use "plasma" TCDD level to predict the TCDD level in "fat tissue".





#### >Lab-06. predicting diamond prices

__Story:__ A diamond distributor has recently decided to exit the market and has put up a set of 3,000 diamonds up for auction. Seeing this as a great opportunity to expand its inventory, a jewelry company has shown interest in making a bid. To decide how much to bid, we will use a large database of diamond prices to build a model to predict the price of a diamond based on its attributes. Then we will use the results of that model to make a recommendation for how much the company should bid.
