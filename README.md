#### >Lab-01. predicting the TCDD level

__Data:__ The data set 'AgOrange.xlsx' is related to a study of Vietnam War veterans who were exposed to Agent-Orange(TCDD) herbicide during the confict. The data set contians TCDD levels in both "plasma" and "fat tissue" for 20 veterans. One goal of us is to determine the degree of linear association between these two variables. We want to use "plasma" TCDD level to predict the TCDD level in "fat tissue".
